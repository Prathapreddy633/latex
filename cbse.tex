\item A departmental store sends bills to charge its customers once a month Past experience shows that $ 70\% $ of its customers pay their first month bill in time. The store also found that the customer who pays the bill in time has the probability of 0.8 of paying in time next month and the customer who doesn't pay in time has the probability of 0.4 of paying in time the next month.
